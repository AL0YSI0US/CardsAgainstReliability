Cards Against Reliability
==========================

Cards Against Reliability is a fork of [Cards Against Cryptography](https://github.com/CardsAgainstCryptography/CAC) and it is based on [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/), which describes itself as "a party game for horrible people". Cards Against Reliability is not quite as mean, but still has bit of an edge. I hope this game is played in a spirit of fun. But if you don't like crude humor, this game may not be for you.

Basic Rules
-----------

1. Each player draws 7 white cards.
2. The person who most recently had a paper rejected begins as the Session Chair and picks a black card. The Session Chair reads the black card aloud and shows it to everyone.
3. Every other player picks 1 white card they think completes the black card best, and submits their white card face down to the Session Chair.
4. The Session Chair executes a mixnet protocol, and reads aloud each card combination (black + white).  The Session Chair picks the combination they think is funniest; whoever submitted it wins the black card.
5. After the round, the next player becomes Session Chair. Everyone draws back up to 7 white cards.
6. At any time, a player may trade in 1 of their black cards to discard as many white cards as they would like and draw back up to 7. A player with no black cards can trade up to 3 white cards at most once per game.
7. The first player to win 5 black cards is declared the winner and awarded tenure.
